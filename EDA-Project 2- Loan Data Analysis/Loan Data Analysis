Loan Data Analysis

Problem description
When a loan application is received it is either approved or declined based on a certain criteria. 
We have to be careful during analysis of such loan applications as if we lend to risky customers who are
likely to default then it could have negative impact on bussiness. Also if we decline a loan to a potential 
customer who could have paid back the loan then it is a loss of bussiness as well.


In this project we will first clean the data then analyse it and give some recommendations based on our findings.
