Project Brief:
Our company wants to make investment in few companies and we want to have a look at the global investment trends so 
that we can make the investment decision wisely. Also we have to keep in mind some constraints while making the investment.

1. The investment should be between 5 to 15 milliion USD per round of investment.

2. The investment should be in only English speaking countries.

Data Source: The Data has been taken from crunchbase.com


Goals of Data Analysis:

1. Investment Type Anslysis: Comparing typical investment amounts in venture, seed, angel, private equity etc

2. Country Analysis: We have to identify the countries which are investors' favorites and they have invested heavily 
in those countries.

3. Sector Analysis: Understanding the distribution of investment among the main sectors. The 2 files 'companies' and 
'rounds2' have numerous sub-sector names. Hence we will have to map each sub-sector to it's main sector.
